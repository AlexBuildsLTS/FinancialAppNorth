## Core User Experience

The user experience is paramount, designed to be intelligent, responsive, and personalized to each user's specific needs and role.

### Visual Identity

The application's aesthetic is clean, professional, and accessible, featuring two meticulously crafted visual themes with a seamless, animated toggle.

* **Typography**: The entire interface utilizes the **Inter** font family, chosen for its exceptional legibility on screens of all sizes, ensuring a comfortable and clear reading experience during prolonged use.
* **Light Theme**: Engineered for clarity in bright environments. It uses a soft, off-white (`#F0F2F5`) background to reduce eye strain, paired with crisp white (`#FFFFFF`) cards. A professional orange (`#BB4711`) serves as the primary accent, chosen to evoke confidence and decisive action.
* **Dark Theme**: Perfect for low-light conditions. It features a deep navy blue (`#0A192F`) background and slightly lighter navy (`#172A45`) cards for subtle depth. A vibrant green (`#1DB954`) accent provides a modern, energetic contrast against the dark backdrop.

### Dynamic & Personalized UI

The interface adapts to the user, providing immediate access to relevant tools and personal information.

* **User Avatar & Profile Dropdown**: The header features the user's avatar as the primary entry point for account management.
  * **Avatar Logic**: The component displays the user's uploaded `avatar_url`. If no image is present, it automatically generates a temporary avatar with the user's first and last initials (e.g., "JS" for John Smith) against a unique, programmatically generated background color that remains consistent for that user.
  * **Dropdown Menu**: Clicking the avatar opens a role-aware dropdown menu with icons for quick navigation:
    * `Edit Profile` (icon: `UserCog`)
    * `Settings` (icon: `Settings`)
    * `Sign Out` (icon: `LogOut`)
    * `Ticket Management` (icon: `HandHelping`) - **This is an exclusive entry point visible only to `Support` and `Administrator` roles for managing the ticket system.**

### Interactive & Insightful Data Visualization

Data is brought to life through a suite of modern, interactive, and smoothly animated charts, rendered with hardware acceleration for fluid performance.

* **Chart Variety**: The dashboard provides a comprehensive financial overview using Ring & Donut Charts, Line Charts, Bar Charts, and advanced Heat Maps & Tree Maps.
* **Deep Interactivity & Drill-Down**: All charts are fully reactive. Tapping a data point (e.g., the "Software" slice of an expense pie chart) immediately navigates the user to a new, detailed view that breaks down every underlying transaction for that specific category and period.

## Feature Suite

### For Personal Finance (Member & Premium)

Core tools designed to empower individuals and small businesses to manage their finances effectively.

* **Intelligent Document Scanning**: The `Scan` tab (`ScanEye` icon) transforms the device's camera into a powerful financial scanner. Using a cloud-based OCR service, it automatically extracts key information—vendor, date, total amount—from physical receipts and invoices, dramatically reducing manual data entry.
* **AI Assistant**: Accessible via the `AI Chat` tab (`BotMessageSquare` icon), this feature provides an integrated assistant with multi-provider support (OpenAI, Gemini, Claude). Users can ask complex financial questions, request summaries of their spending, and gain insights into their data. Requires a user-provided API key.
* **Budgeting & Forecasting**: A comprehensive suite of tools for financial planning. Users can create detailed budgets using various methodologies, including **envelope budgeting**. The system also supports **rollover budgets**, where unused or overspent amounts from one period automatically carry over to the next.
* **Bookkeeping & Reconciliation**: The foundation of the app. Users can accurately record all financial transactions following double-entry principles and manage multiple sets of books (e.g., separating personal and business finances).

#### Premium Member Upgrades

Subscribed `Premium` users unlock powerful enhancements within the existing interface, designed for those who need more control and insight.

* **In-depth Analytics & Multi-year Forecasting**: The `Reports` tab is upgraded with advanced analytics tools, allowing users to compare financial data across multiple years and generate sophisticated forecast models.
* **Advanced Tax Preparation Summaries**: Generate detailed, country-specific tax summaries (initially supporting Sweden, UK, US standards) to streamline tax filing.
* **Data Export to CSV/PDF**: An "Export" button is unlocked on the `Transactions` screen, allowing users to download their financial data for use in other applications or for archival purposes.
* **Custom Categorization Rules**: In `Settings`, Premium users can create powerful automation rules (e.g., "All transactions from 'Spotify' are automatically categorized as 'Entertainment'"), saving significant time on manual bookkeeping.
* **Scheduled Reporting**: Automate financial oversight by scheduling core reports (P&L, Balance Sheet) to be automatically generated and emailed on a recurring basis.

### For Professional Accounting (CPA)

A dedicated suite of tools for accounting professionals, centered around client management.

* **Client Management Dashboard**: The `Clients` tab (`UsersRound` icon) is the central hub for CPAs. It provides a comprehensive overview of all assigned clients, pending requests, and key client alerts.
* **Segregated & Secure Workspaces**: Clicking on a client transports the CPA into a secure, sandboxed environment. This workspace contains only that client's data, eliminating any risk of data contamination. A persistent header always displays the active client's name as a critical safety feature.
* **Brandable Reporting**: CPAs can generate professional reports for their clients that can be customized with the CPA's own firm logo and branding, enhancing their professional image.

### Universal Support Ticket System

A comprehensive ticketing system is integrated to handle all user support requests, accessible to everyone via the main `Support` tab.

* **User-Facing View**: The `Support` screen for non-staff users presents two clear options: **`Create New Ticket`** and **`View My Tickets`**. This allows users to easily submit new requests (with Topic and Description) and track the history and status of their existing tickets.
* **Staff-Facing View**: For `Support` and `Administrator` roles, the `Support` tab transforms into a powerful management dashboard. It displays a master list of all tickets from all users, with robust filtering, sorting, and a private section for **Internal Notes** visible only to other staff members.

### A Living Interface: The Philosophy of Animation

Animations are a core component of the user experience, providing feedback, guiding focus, and creating a sense of quality.

* **Component & Screen Transitions**: New screens slide in with native, physics-based transitions. Data-heavy screens first display shimmering skeleton loaders that precisely match the layout of the content, which then gracefully fade out as the real data fades in.
* **Data State Changes**: When a value in a metric card updates, the numbers animate a quick scroll from the old value to the new.
* **Micro-interactions & Tactile Feedback**: Buttons subtly scale down on press. When an item is deleted from a list, it animates its height to zero and fades out, and the surrounding items smoothly animate to fill the empty space.
* **Navigational Cues**: The active icon in the bottom tab bar performs a subtle animation, like a gentle bounce, to clearly indicate the current state.

## Security First: A Commitment to Privacy

Security is not an afterthought; it is a foundational pillar of NorthFinance.

* **Authentication & Authorization**: User authentication is managed by Supabase Auth, leveraging modern security standards including optional Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) via TOTP apps or **WebAuthn/Passkeys**. Access to data is strictly controlled by PostgreSQL's Row Level Security (RLS), ensuring users can only ever access their own information.
* **End-to-End Encryption (E2EE)**: All user-to-user and user-to-CPA communication within the real-time messaging feature is end-to-end encrypted. This means only the sender and intended recipient can read the messages, ensuring absolute privacy for sensitive financial discussions.
* **Secure Storage**: On mobile platforms, sensitive information like cryptographic keys is stored in the device's hardware-backed secure enclave using `expo-secure-store`. This provides the highest level of security for stored credentials.

* **Secure Document Management**: A dedicated `Documents` tab provides a secure vault for uploading, storing, and managing important financial documents like bills, invoices, contracts, and bank statements. Files can be attached to specific transactions for easy reference.
* **AI Assistant**: An integrated assistant with multi-provider support (OpenAI, Gemini, Claude) for answering financial questions and analyzing data. Requires a user-provided API key.
* **Budgeting & Forecasting**: A comprehensive suite of tools for financial planning. Users can create detailed budgets using various methodologies, including **envelope budgeting**. The system also supports **rollover budgets**.

### Localization & Internationalization

The application is designed for a global user base, with features that adapt to the user's region.

* **Country & Currency Selection**: In `Settings`, users can select their country and preferred currency (initially supporting `SEK`, `EUR`, `GBP`).
* **Adaptive Features**: The chosen country will tailor features like the **Tax Preparation Summaries** to match local standards. The selected currency will become the base currency for all reporting and conversions.

## Advanced Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

## Client-to-CPA Connection Workflow

Connecting a user with an accounting professional is a secure and managed process with two distinct pathways:

* **1. Administrator-Led Assignment**:
    1. An `Administrator` navigates to the User Management section in the `Admin Panel`.
    2. They select a `Member` or `Premium Member` user to edit.
    3. Using a searchable dropdown of all registered CPAs, they assign a professional to the user.
    4. The connection is established instantly.

* **2. User-Initiated Request**:
    1. A `Member` or `Premium Member` navigates to the "Find an Accountant" section in their `Settings`.
    2. They browse or search a public list of available CPAs.
    3. The user clicks "Request Connection," which sends a secure notification to the CPA.
    4. The request appears in the CPA's `Clients` dashboard as "Pending."
    5. The CPA can then review the request and **Accept** or **Decline** it. The user is notified of the outcome.

---

## Technical Architecture

* **Frontend**: React Native & Expo (SDK 53) with TypeScript. Navigation is handled by **Expo Router** for a file-based, native-like routing experience.
* **Backend**: **Supabase** was chosen for its integrated suite of tools. We utilize its PostgreSQL database, Auth (with RLS), Realtime capabilities for live data synchronization, and Edge Functions for serverless logic.
* **Deployment**: The web application is deployed to **Vercel** for optimal performance and scalability. Mobile builds for the Apple App Store and Google Play Store are managed and distributed via **EAS (Expo Application Services)**.

---

## Platform Notes

* **Environment Variables**: For web builds, Expo uses the `extra` field in `app.config.js`. Ensure `SUPABASE_URL`, `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`, and other keys are set in your environment before running.
* **Secure Storage**: Mobile builds use `expo-secure-store` for hardware-backed security. Web falls back to `localStorage` for development convenience. Production-grade key storage on the web should consider server-backed solutions.
* **Crypto Polyfill (React Native)**: For native builds, `window.crypto.subtle` is not available by default and requires polyfills like `react-native-get-random-values` and `react-native-quick-crypto`.

## Advanced Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

The application is built on a robust, role-based permission system. `Premium Member` is a direct upgrade for personal use, while `Professional (CPA)` is a distinct track for client management.

| Role | Description | Key Permissions |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Member** | The default role for all new users. Designed for personal use. | • Manage own financial data and budgets.<br />• Use camera scanning & AI assistant.<br />• Generate standard financial reports.<br />• Create and manage support tickets.<br />• **Initiate connection requests** to a CPA. |

## Dynamic Navigation System

The primary navigation is a dynamic bottom tab bar that adapts based on the user's role, ensuring a clean and relevant interface. Users will **only see the tabs available to their role**.

| Icon (`lucide-react-native`) | Title | Description | Visible To |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `Home` | Dashboard | Main overview of financial health, charts, and metrics. | All |
| `List` | Transactions | A detailed, searchable list of all financial transactions. | Member, Premium, CPA, Admin |
| `ScanEye` | Scan | Scan physical documents with OCR to create new transactions. | Member, Premium, CPA |
| `BotMessageSquare`| AI Chat | Interact with the AI financial assistant for insights. | Member, Premium, CPA |
| `BarChart2` | Reports | Generate and view financial reports like P&L and Balance Sheets. | Member, Premium, CPA |
| `user-pen` | Clients | Access the client management dashboard and workspaces. | CPA, Support, Admin |

| `Settings` | Settings | Configure application, profile, and security settings. | All |
| `Landmark`| Admin Panel| The central hub for all system and user management tools. | Administrator Only |

## Client-to-CPA Connection Workflow

Connecting a user with an accounting professional is a secure and managed process with two distinct pathways:

* **1. Administrator-Led Assignment**:
    1. An `Administrator` navigates to the User Management section in the `Admin Panel`.
    2. They select a `Member` or `Premium Member` user to edit.
    3. Using a searchable dropdown of all registered CPAs, they assign a professional to the user.
    4. The connection is established instantly.

* **2. User-Initiated Request**:
    1. A `Member` or `Premium Member` navigates to the "Find an Accountant" section in their `Settings`.
    2. They browse or search a public list of available CPAs.
    3. The user clicks "Request Connection," which sends a secure notification to the CPA.
    4. The request appears in the CPA's `Clients` dashboard as "Pending."
    5. The CPA can then review the request and **Accept** or **Decline** it. The user is notified of the outcome.

* **Frontend**: React Native & Expo (SDK 53) with TypeScript. Navigation is handled by **Expo Router** for a file-based, native-like routing experience.
* **Backend**: **Supabase** was chosen for its integrated suite of tools. We utilize its PostgreSQL database, Auth (with RLS), Realtime capabilities for live data synchronization, and Edge Functions for serverless logic.
* **Deployment**: The web application is deployed to **Vercel** for optimal performance and scalability. Mobile builds for the Apple App Store and Google Play Store are managed and distributed via **EAS (Expo Application Services)**.
